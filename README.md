   2)Sales performance by product category
   3)Sales performance by region
   4)Comparative analysis using visual charts

# Key Business Insights

  1)The Technology category generates the highest sales revenue
  2)Sales performance varies significantly across regions2
  3)Some categories show strong sales but lower profit margins
  4)Insights support data-driven decision-making

# Visualizations

  1)Sales by Category – Bar Chart
  2)Sales by Region – Bar Chart

All visualizations are available in the Jupyter Notebook.

# Conclusion
